# Development

## Prerequisites

- Git
- GitHub CLI (`gh`), installed and authenticated
- `jq`
- Codex or Claude CLI when that agent is selected
- Project-specific tools documented in this file after the template is adopted

Run `./scripts/doctor.sh` to check these prerequisites. It reports each check
as `OK`, `WARNING`, or `FAILED` with a fix hint, exits non-zero when a required
prerequisite is missing, and never modifies anything. A missing agent CLI
fails when `.agents/agents.conf` assigns it to a role and is a warning
otherwise.

Keep `./scripts/verify.sh` as the stable verification entry point for humans,
agents, and CI.

## Configuring verification

`./scripts/verify.sh` runs the checks declared in `scripts/verify.conf`, one
per line:

```text
<name>: <command>
```

After adopting the template, replace the template checks with those of the
project's stack, for example:

```text
lint: ruff check .
tests: pytest
```

Every listed check is required. Each command runs with `bash -eo pipefail`
from the repository root, so a failing step in a pipeline or command sequence
fails the check. Its first word is the required tool. Verification fails
when that tool is missing or not executable, when a command exits non-zero, or
when the configuration is missing, empty, or malformed. All checks run even
after a failure, and a summary lists each check as `PASS` or `FAIL`.

There is no automatic stack detection and no optional check: remove a check
from `scripts/verify.conf` rather than letting it be skipped.

## Configuring agents

`.agents/agents.conf` assigns a provider and model to each workflow role, one
per line:

```text
<role>: <provider> <model>
```

| Role | Used by |
|---|---|
| `project-grill`, `project-planner` | `start-planning.sh` |
| `planning-reviewer` | reserved for planning review |
| `implementer` | `start-feature.sh` |
| `reviewer` | `review-feature.sh` |
| `triage` | `triage-review.sh` |
| `triage-implementer` | `apply-triage.sh` |

Supported providers are `codex` and `claude`. Set each model to one your
account supports, and use a different provider for a reviewing role than for
the role whose work it reviews.

Every workflow script accepts `--agent <agent>` and `--model <model>` to
override the configuration for one run. Overriding the provider requires a
model as well. The model is always passed to the provider, for Claude as well
as Codex, and is never replaced: an unknown provider, missing CLI, missing
model, or malformed configuration fails before the script creates a branch,
worktree, or file, and a model the provider rejects fails the run.

Agents run with one of two permission profiles:

- `write`: an interactive session that may modify its worktree. Codex runs in
  a workspace-write sandbox without approval prompts; Claude accepts edits
  automatically. Used for planning, implementation, and applying triage.
- `read-only`: a non-interactive session that cannot modify files and gets no
  MCP servers, apps, or other tools from the user's configuration. Codex runs
  in a read-only sandbox without the user's `config.toml`, with apps, browser
  use, computer use, and web search disabled. Claude runs restricted: without user, project, or MCP
  configuration, with only its Read, Glob, and Grep tools, and without asking
  for any further permission. The script stores the agent's result. Used for
  review and triage.

A profile that a provider cannot enforce is an error; an agent is never started
with broader permissions instead.

## Project bootstrap workflow

Run project bootstrap from a clean checkout after recording the initial project
idea and completing `docs/repository-setup.md`:

```bash
./scripts/start-planning.sh
```

The full interface is:

```text
./scripts/start-planning.sh [name] [--description <file>] [--agent <agent>] [--model <model>]
```

If you already have a project description, pass it with `--description`:

```bash
./scripts/start-planning.sh --description ~/notes/project-idea.md
```

The file may be anywhere, including outside the repository. An uncommitted
description inside the repository is the one change the clean-checkout check
allows.
The script copies it to `docs/PROJECT_DESCRIPTION.md` in the planning worktree
before the first session. Project Grill reads it first and asks only about
what it leaves unresolved. Neither planning phase may modify it, and it is
committed with the planning branch as the recorded input. A missing, empty, or
non-regular file fails before a branch or worktree is created.

Project Grill uses role `project-grill` and the planning session uses role
`project-planner`; `--agent` and `--model` override both. The optional name
defaults to `project-bootstrap`. A custom planning cycle such as:

```bash
./scripts/start-planning.sh architecture-refresh
```

creates `planning/architecture-refresh` in a sibling worktree named
`../<repository>-planning-architecture-refresh`.

The script fetches `origin/main` and creates the planning branch from that
remote ref without switching or modifying the primary checkout. It refuses a
dirty checkout, unsafe name, missing agent or prompt, unavailable base,
duplicate branch, or existing target path.

Bootstrap has two separate interactive agent sessions:

1. Project Grill reads the project context, asks only questions that materially
   affect product or technical direction, and refines
   `docs/PROJECT_REQUIREMENTS.md` in Draft state.
2. The script validates and displays the requirements. It records Approved
   status and a UTC timestamp only after explicit human confirmation.
3. A fresh project-planner session consumes the approved requirements and
   creates or updates `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/roadmap.md`, and only
   necessary ADRs under `docs/decisions/`.

Declining requirements approval or an agent failure stops the workflow and
leaves the planning worktree intact. Inspect or revise it there; the script
never substitutes another model or removes user work automatically.

After successful planning, review the artifacts and complete the process
manually:

```bash
cd ../<repository>-planning-project-bootstrap
./scripts/verify.sh
git add docs/PROJECT_DESCRIPTION.md  # only when --description was used
git add docs/PROJECT_REQUIREMENTS.md docs/architecture.md docs/roadmap.md docs/decisions
git commit -m "Plan project bootstrap"
git push -u origin planning/project-bootstrap
```

Open and merge a planning PR before creating Issues for actionable roadmap
features. The script never implements features, creates Issues, commits,
pushes, opens or merges a PR, or deploys.

## Canonical feature workflow

Start with an actionable GitHub Issue. Create a detailed implementation plan
under `.agents/plans/` for non-trivial work when warranted.

From a clean primary checkout, create the feature worktree and start the
implementation agent:

```bash
./scripts/start-feature.sh 12 player-movement
```

The full interface is:

```text
./scripts/start-feature.sh <issue> <slug> [base-branch] [--agent <agent>] [--model <model>]
```

The script fetches the selected remote base, creates `feature/<issue>-<slug>`
in a sibling worktree, and starts the agent of role `implementer` inside that
worktree.

After the implementation agent exits, enter the feature worktree and verify:

```bash
cd ../project-12-player-movement
./scripts/verify.sh
```

When independent review is required by `.agents/policies/autonomy.md`, run it
before committing so the reviewer includes the complete working-tree changes:

```bash
./scripts/review-feature.sh 12
```

The full interface is:

```text
./scripts/review-feature.sh <issue> [base-branch] [--agent <agent>] [--model <model>]
```

It uses role `reviewer` with the `read-only` profile. The review is
non-interactive: the reviewer cannot modify files and has no network access, so
the script supplies the GitHub Issue and the complete diff against the base
branch, including uncommitted and untracked changes. The reviewer returns its
result as JSON and the script validates and stores it. An invalid result is
retried once and then rejected, and a reviewer that changed the working tree or
created a commit is reported as an error; in both cases no review is stored.

The review script must run from the matching feature worktree and needs an
authenticated GitHub CLI. Each round writes a numbered pair of files without
overwriting earlier reviews:

```text
.agents/reviews/feature-12-player-movement-review-01.json
.agents/reviews/feature-12-player-movement-review-01.md
```

See "Review and triage data" below for the two files.

Triage an explicit review artifact with an agent independent from the
implementation:

```bash
./scripts/triage-review.sh \
  .agents/reviews/feature-12-player-movement-review-01.json
```

The full interface is:

```text
./scripts/triage-review.sh <review-json> [--agent <agent>] [--model <model>]
```

The triage agent (role `triage`) classifies every finding as:

- `FIX_NOW`: resolve before the feature proceeds. Critical and Major findings
  always use this category.
- `DEFER`: valid non-blocking work proposed as a separate follow-up Issue.
- `ACCEPT`: consciously take no action, with an explicit rationale.

The script validates the decisions before showing them: every finding is
decided exactly once, Critical and Major findings are `FIX_NOW`, and a deferred
finding has a follow-up title, action, and acceptance criteria. Invalid
decisions are retried once and then rejected. A review without findings needs
no triage agent.

The script displays the complete proposal before side effects. Only after
interactive approval does it create one GitHub Issue per `DEFER` finding and
write a persistent, uniquely named artifact such as:

```text
.agents/triage/feature-12-player-movement-review-01-triage.json
.agents/triage/feature-12-player-movement-review-01-triage.md
```

That artifact maps the source review findings to their decisions and any
created Issue numbers. Declining the proposal creates neither an artifact nor
Issues. The source review remains unchanged. The artifact is stored only after
every follow-up Issue exists; if creating one fails, nothing is stored and a
new triage reuses the Issues created so far, which it finds by their trace
token. A re-run reuses a follow-up Issue that already exists for a finding.

Deferred follow-up Issue titles include deterministic provenance:

```text
[F02][R01][S2] Concise follow-up title
```

The script obtains the feature ID from the source Issue title and the review
round and finding ID from the review. When no feature ID is available, it falls
back to the source Issue number:

```text
[#12][R01][S2] Concise follow-up title
```

Apply the approved `FIX_NOW` set from the same feature worktree:

```bash
./scripts/apply-triage.sh \
  .agents/triage/feature-12-player-movement-review-01-triage.json
```

The full interface is:

```text
./scripts/apply-triage.sh <triage-json> [--agent <agent>] [--model <model>]
```

The helper uses role `triage-implementer`. It validates the approved artifact and source review, shows the exact
`FIX_NOW` scope, and asks for confirmation before starting a write-capable
agent. It never passes `DEFER` or `ACCEPT` findings to that agent. After the
agent exits, it verifies that the review and triage artifacts are unchanged and
runs `./scripts/verify.sh`.

The helper does not commit, push, merge, deploy, or create/close Issues. Inspect
the resulting diff and run another independent review and triage when fixes
require confirmation.

### Review and triage data

Results that an agent writes and a script consumes are JSON. Each review and
each triage is stored as two files with the same name:

- `.json` is the source of truth. The scripts read only this file.
- `.md` is a report generated from the JSON for reading. It is never parsed;
  editing it has no effect.

The agent's result must match a schema in `.agents/schemas/`
(`review.schema.json`, `triage.schema.json`). The schema is passed to the
provider CLI and the script checks the result again with `jq`, including rules
a schema cannot express. For a review, the verdict must follow from the
findings: `PASS` without findings, `PASS_WITH_MINOR_FINDINGS` with only minor
or suggestion findings, and `CHANGES_REQUIRED` with at least one critical or
major finding. What a reviewer could not verify belongs in `limitations` and
does not change the verdict.

The script, not the agent, numbers the findings: `C1` (critical), `M1` (major),
`MIN1` (minor), and `S1` (suggestion). Triage decisions and follow-up Issues
refer to those identifiers. When a result is invalid, the agent is asked once
more, with the reasons for the rejection.

Stored artifacts are checked with the same rules as agent results, plus the
fields the scripts own, so editing a stored artifact cannot weaken a decision.

Documents that people maintain, such as the roadmap, requirements, and
architecture, keep Markdown as their source.

### When a review becomes stale

Every review records a fingerprint of what it reviewed (`reviewed_tree`): the
Git tree hash of the file contents at review time, including uncommitted and
untracked changes. Review and triage artifacts and ignored files are not part
of it, except files Git already tracks. A review may instead cover an explicit
list of files (`reviewed_paths`); then only those files count.

The fingerprint depends on content, not on commits. Committing the reviewed
content keeps the review current; changing, adding, or deleting a covered file
makes it stale. `triage-review.sh` and `apply-triage.sh` refuse a stale review
before they start an agent. After `apply-triage.sh` changes the code, the
review is stale by design: run a new review when the fixes need confirmation.

Check a review yourself with:

```bash
./scripts/check-review.sh .agents/reviews/feature-12-player-movement-review-01.json
```

It exits 0 when the review is current, 1 when it is stale, and 2 on an error.

Verify again after review fixes, then commit and push:

```bash
./scripts/verify.sh
git add .
git commit -m "Implement player movement"
git push -u origin feature/12-player-movement
```

Open a PR containing `Closes #12`. After CI and required human gates pass,
merge it; GitHub then closes the linked Issue. From the primary checkout,
remove the merged worktree:

```bash
./scripts/cleanup-worktree.sh ../project-12-player-movement
```

## Linking a feature plan

To add or update the plan reference in an existing Issue:

```bash
./scripts/update-issue-with-plan.sh 12 .agents/plans/12-player-movement.md
```

The helper manages one delimited plan block in the Issue body. Re-running it
updates that block instead of appending duplicates. It stores only the
repository-relative plan path; the detailed plan remains in `.agents/plans/`.

## Lifecycle summary

Roadmap item → GitHub Issue → optional implementation plan → isolated feature
worktree → implementation → verification → independent review when required →
triage → apply approved `FIX_NOW` findings → verification/re-review when needed
→ commit → push/PR → CI and gates → merge → automatic Issue closure → worktree
cleanup.

Do not use `scripts/finish-feature.sh` as part of this flow until it has been
redesigned or deprecated; its interface predates the current review script.
